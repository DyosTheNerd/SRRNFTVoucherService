## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That’s this file, describing the scope of the project

← `public/style.css`: The styling rules for the pages in your site.

← `server.js`: The **Node.js** server script for your new site. The JavaScript defines the endpoints in the site
back-end, one to return the homepage and one to update with the submitted color. Each one sends data to a Handlebars
template which builds these parameter values into the web page the visitor sees.

← `package.json`: The NPM packages for your project's dependencies.

← `src/`: This folder holds the site template along with some basic data files.

← `src/pages/index.hbs`: This is the main page template for your site. The template receives parameters from the server
script, which it includes in the page HTML. The page sends the user submitted color value in the body of a request, or
as a query parameter to choose a random color.

← `src/colors.json`: A collection of CSS color names. We use this in the server script to pick a random color, and to
match searches against color names.

← `src/seo.json`: When you're ready to share your new site or add a custom domain, change SEO/meta settings in here.

## Create your own designs

You can use the template builder best, if you follow these guidelines in the structure of your SVG:

- Use Inkscape to create your source file
- All elements are at the position where they should be in the final version of the image.
- The First level of layers are feature in the image generation process that can be
  randomized. Their name will be used in the process: e.g. if the Inkscape name of a top level layer is "hats" there
  will be a "hats" feature
- The direct sub-layers will contain the possible elements of that feature, eg. a sub-layer could be a cowboy hat, and a
  second sub-layer of hats could be a pirate hat.
